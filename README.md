I am a Full-Stack developer in training. I create content on the side mainly for fun, however, I do accept commissions if it is within my skillset. 
If you have a request, email me at tmilarck.coding@gmail.com. Here on the main page, you will find folders containing the content that I have created.
The content shown on the folders show my current limitations. As I gain more experience, more folders will be added in the future.
